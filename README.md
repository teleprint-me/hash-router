# hash-router
A vanilla javascript hash router created alongside ChatGPT


## Notes
It's challenging to get and save the full conversations with ChatGTP because open.ai is still in the development process and is rapidly making progress. Unfortunately, this has broken multiple tools that I've been using to backup conversations I've had with it. open.ai's servers have also been bogged down due to it's popularity and them being unable to meet demand. I am unable to share the full conversations due to data loss, corrupted saves, intermittent and interrupted sessions, and more due to the previously mentioned issues.

I may take the time to restore and reformat those conversations so that I can salvage what I can in the future just to have as a reference and backup. Although, this is unlikely due to the limited amount of time I have recently. If I do this, I will only be able to supply ChatGPT's responses which is why I'm reticent towards investing time into this endeavor. It's frustrating having lost my portion of the conversations having spent all week attempting to get into the necessary flow where GPT fluidly cooperates alongside you and behaves as a pair programmer instead of directly coding for you which is in my opinion just as important for understanding the context and how the code came about.

I am definitely looking forward to working with this technology in the future and am unsure of where it will take us. 

However, I'm sure it will be many things and it will be anything but boring.
